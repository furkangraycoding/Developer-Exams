# Build Fix Guide

## Issues Fixed

### ✅ 1. Swift Compilation Errors - FIXED

**Issues Found:**
- Missing backward compatibility for new fields (`totalCoins`, `isClaimed`, `coinReward`)
- Duplicate achievement type enum case (`unstoppable`)

**Fixes Applied:**
1. **UserStatistics** - Added custom `init(from decoder:)` to handle missing `totalCoins` field
2. **Achievement** - Added custom `init(from decoder:)` to handle missing `isClaimed` and `coinReward` fields
3. **AchievementType** - Removed duplicate `unstoppable` enum case (using `streak50` instead)

These fixes ensure backward compatibility with existing saved data.

## ⚠️ Remaining Issue: Info.plist Build Error

### Error Message:
```
The Copy Bundle Resources build phase contains this target's Info.plist file 
'/Users/furkangurcay/Desktop/Developer-Exams/CoderQuest/InfoAd.plist'
```

### What This Means:
The `InfoAd.plist` file is incorrectly included in the "Copy Bundle Resources" build phase. Xcode automatically handles Info.plist files, so they should NOT be in Copy Bundle Resources.

### How to Fix in Xcode:

#### Option 1: Remove from Copy Bundle Resources (Recommended)
1. Open your Xcode project
2. Select the **CoderQuest** target
3. Go to **Build Phases** tab
4. Expand **Copy Bundle Resources**
5. Find `InfoAd.plist` in the list
6. Select it and click the **minus (-)** button to remove it
7. Clean build folder: **Product → Clean Build Folder** (Cmd+Shift+K)
8. Build again: **Product → Build** (Cmd+B)

#### Option 2: If InfoAd.plist is Not Needed
If this file is not your main Info.plist:
1. In Xcode's Project Navigator (left sidebar)
2. Find `InfoAd.plist`
3. Right-click → **Delete**
4. Choose **Move to Trash**
5. Clean and rebuild

#### Option 3: Verify Target Settings
1. Select the **CoderQuest** target
2. Go to **Build Settings** tab
3. Search for "Info.plist"
4. Ensure **Info.plist File** is set to the correct path:
   - Should be: `CoderQuest/Info.plist`
   - NOT: `CoderQuest/InfoAd.plist`
5. If wrong, correct the path
6. Clean and rebuild

## Verification Steps

After fixing the Info.plist issue:

### 1. Clean Build
```bash
# In Xcode
Product → Clean Build Folder (Cmd+Shift+K)
```

### 2. Rebuild
```bash
# In Xcode
Product → Build (Cmd+B)
```

### 3. Run
```bash
# In Xcode
Product → Run (Cmd+R)
```

## Testing Checklist

Once the build succeeds:

### First Launch (New User)
1. App opens to username input view
2. Enter username
3. Navigates to main menu
4. Shows Level 1, 0 Coins
5. No achievements unlocked

### Returning User
1. App opens directly to main menu (skips username)
2. Username displayed correctly
3. Level and coins displayed
4. Previous achievements still there

### Achievement System
1. Play quiz to unlock achievement
2. Check achievements view
3. Unlocked achievement shows "Claim Prize!" badge
4. Tap achievement for details
5. Tap "Claim Rewards" button
6. XP and Coins added to totals
7. Badge changes to "Claimed!"

### Backward Compatibility
1. If you had old save data, it should load
2. Old achievements should be claimable
3. Coins start at 0
4. Level recalculates with new formula

## Common Issues

### Issue: "Cannot find 'isClaimed' in scope"
**Solution**: Already fixed with custom decoder

### Issue: "Cannot find 'totalCoins' in scope"
**Solution**: Already fixed with custom decoder

### Issue: Info.plist error persists
**Solution**: Follow Option 1 above to remove from Copy Bundle Resources

### Issue: Old data not loading
**Solution**: Custom decoders handle this automatically with `decodeIfPresent`

## Summary

**Swift Code**: ✅ All fixed
**Build Configuration**: ⚠️ Manual fix required (Info.plist)

Follow the "How to Fix in Xcode" section above to resolve the remaining build error.
