# UI Enhancements Summary

## Fixed Issues

### 1. ✅ Swift Compiler Error
**Issue**: Line 695 - "The compiler is unable to type-check this expression in reasonable time"

**Solution**: 
- Broke down the complex `RevolutionaryChoiceButton` body into smaller computed properties
- Created separate properties for gradients, badges, backgrounds, and UI components
- Made the code more maintainable and compiler-friendly

### 2. ✅ Achievement Unlock Bug
**Issue**: Achievements weren't being saved as unlocked, causing them to show repeatedly

**Solution**:
- Fixed the `checkAchievements()` method in `ProgressManager.swift`
- Changed the order: now updates `currentCount` first, then unlocks the achievement
- This prevents the `isUnlocked` flag from being overwritten

### 3. ✅ Achievement Card Sizing Issue
**Issue**: Locked and unlocked achievement cards had different heights

**Solution**:
- Added a fixed height container (`.frame(height: 34)`) for the status section
- Both locked (with progress bar) and unlocked (with "Unlocked!" badge) states now maintain consistent card sizes

## Question View UI Improvements

### Enhanced Points Badge
- **Multi-layer animated glows**: 4 pulsing glow layers with staggered animations
- **Rotating gradient star**: Angular gradient that rotates continuously with shimmer effect
- **Glass reflection effect**: Top shine for glossy appearance
- **Enhanced shadows**: Multiple shadow layers for depth
- **Improved typography**: Larger, bolder points display with gradient text
- **Better animations**: Floating and scaling effects

### Premium Question Header
- **Animated status indicators**: 3 pulsing dots with sequential animation delays
- **Branded badge**: "QUESTION" label with brain icon in a capsule
- **Enhanced colors**: Better contrast and visibility

### Icon Circle Enhancements
- **Dual rotating rings**: Two counter-rotating rings around the icon
- **4-layer breathing glows**: Multi-layered radial gradients with breathing animation
- **Glass effect**: Reflection overlay for realistic glass appearance
- **Enhanced borders**: White-to-color gradient border (4.5px)
- **Gradient icon**: White-to-color gradient for the brain icon
- **Multiple shadows**: Layered shadows for depth

### Question Text Display
- **Background container**: Rounded rectangle with subtle gradient background
- **Border**: White border for definition
- **Better spacing**: Increased line spacing and padding
- **Shadow effects**: Soft shadow for depth
- **Gradient text**: White gradient for premium look

### Card Background
- **4-color gradient**: More sophisticated color transitions
- **Glass reflection**: Top shine overlay
- **Enhanced border**: 6-color gradient border (4px width)
- **Triple shadows**: Three shadow layers for maximum depth and glow

### Animations
- **Shimmer effect**: New rotating shimmer on the points badge
- **Breathing glows**: Pulsing glow effects with staggered timing
- **Floating motion**: Smooth up/down movement
- **Scale effects**: Subtle scaling on various elements

## Achievement Card Improvements

### Consistent Sizing

- Better grid appearance in the achievements view

## Technical Improvements

### Code Organization
- Extracted complex expressions into computed properties
- Better separation of concerns
- Easier to maintain and modify
- Faster compilation times

### Performance
- More efficient animations
- Optimized gradient calculations
- Better use of SwiftUI's rendering pipeline

## Color Enhancements
