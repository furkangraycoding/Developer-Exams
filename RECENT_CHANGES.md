### 3. **Fixed Achievement Pop-ups**

**Problem**: Old achievements were showing when game ended.

**Solution**:
- Clear `recentlyUnlockedAchievements` at the start of `recordGameSession()`
- Clear achievements on `restartGame()`
- Added 0.5s delay before showing new achievement popups

**Changes Made**:
```swift
// In recordGameSession():
progressManager.recentlyUnlockedAchievements.removeAll()

// In restartGame():
progressManager.recentlyUnlockedAchievements.removeAll()

// In onChange game over:
DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 0.5) {
    if !progressManager.recentlyUnlockedAchievements.isEmpty {
        withAnimation {
            showAchievementPopup = true
        }
    }
}
```

**Result**: Only newly unlocked achievements show after each game.
