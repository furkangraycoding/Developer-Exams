# Debug Notes

## Issue Fixed: App Stuck on Splash Screen

### Problem
App was getting stuck on the splash screen and not transitioning to main menu.

### Root Causes
1. **Binding Logic Issue**: The splash view was using `@Binding var isActive: Bool` but setting it to `true` wasn't working properly
2. **Timer Issues**: Multiple Timer instances in ParticlesView causing potential performance problems
3. **Set<String> Encoding**: UserProgress.languagesPlayed as Set<String> might cause Codable issues

### Solutions Applied

#### 1. Fixed Splash Screen Transition
**Before:**
```swift
@Binding var isActive: Bool
// Set to true to dismiss
isActive = true
```

**After:**
```swift
@Binding var showSplash: Bool
// Set to false to dismiss (clearer logic)
showSplash = false
```

**Also changed app structure:**
```swift
ZStack {
    if !showSplash {
        MainMenuView()
    }
    if showSplash {
        ModernSplashView()
            .zIndex(1)
    }
}
```

#### 2. Optimized ParticlesView
- Added proper timer cleanup with `onDisappear`
- Added size validation before generating particles
- Reduced particle count from 20 to 15
- Added timer invalidation to prevent memory leaks

#### 3. Fixed UserProgress Codable
Changed `Set<String>` to `[String]` for languagesPlayed:
```swift
var languagesPlayed: [String] // Was: Set<String>
```

Updated ProgressManager to handle duplicates:
```swift
func addLanguage(_ language: String) {
    if !userProgress.languagesPlayed.contains(language) {
        userProgress.languagesPlayed.append(language)
    }
}
```

#### 4. Added Debug Logging
- ProgressManager initialization
- MainMenuView appearance
- Splash transition timing
- UserProgress initialization

### Testing
1. Run the app
2. Check console for these logs:
   ```
   ðŸ”„ Initializing ProgressManager...
   âœ… Created new UserProgress (or Loaded existing progress)
   ðŸš€ Transitioning to main menu...
   ðŸ“± MainMenuView appeared
   ðŸŽ¨ Generating particles...
   ```

### What to Check
- Splash screen should show for 2 seconds
- Console should show transition log
- MainMenuView should appear smoothly
- No memory leaks or performance issues

### Simulator Warnings (Can Ignore)
These CoreTelephony errors are normal in simulator:
```
Error Domain=NSCocoaErrorDomain Code=4099 
"The connection to service named com.apple.commcenter.coretelephony.xpc was invalidated"
```

### AdMob Warnings (Optional Fix)
SKAdNetwork warnings can be fixed by adding networks to Info.plist, but not critical for development.

## Performance Notes
- Removed heavy particle animation from splash screen
- Optimized MainMenuView particle count
- Added proper cleanup for timers
- Delayed particle loading until MainMenuView is fully loaded
